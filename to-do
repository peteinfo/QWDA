Plan to build devices 

- Survey of pellets 

  - What are other researchers using? 

  - Whatâ€™s commercially available? 

  - Do we want to process/sort/make our own (probably not!) 

  - Peas? 

- Survey of dispensing mechanisms 

  - FED device (done!) 

  - What else exists that is open source 

  - Try printing some mechanisms with minimal editing 

  - What scales easily? (what is tweaked simply) 

- CAD (makes some basic levers/joysticks) 

  - Survey what exists (rat levers) also compile academic references 

  - Get comfortable with CAD doing some really simple levers etc 

  - What software? (uni license?) 

    - Fusion? 

    - Rhino? 

  - Try some basic parametric design (from the start) 

- PCBs 

  - Decide on some software 

  - KiCAD / Eagle / whatever you like 

  - Make something simple (shield?) as soon as possible 

- Design version 0.1 

  - All three of the above 

  - Include visual feedback LED? 

  - Document on Github
